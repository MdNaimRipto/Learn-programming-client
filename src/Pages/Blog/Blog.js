                        CORS is the mechanism that provides the ability to alter the behavior of this policy, enabling you to do things like hosting static content and the backend API. This kind of request would be called a Cross-Origin request, as a resource from one subdomain is requesting a resource from another subdomain.

                        This is all controlled through preflight requests that exchange a set of HTTP request headers and corresponding response headers collectively referred to as "CORS Headers", each of these headers modifies a different element of the Same-Origin policy to loosen the limitations it imposes.

                        For user authentication and hosting I am using firebase. For implementing firebase authentication We need an auth, some authenticate functions and Firebase config file. And also a method to hide the firebase config file.

                        PrivateRoute component is the blueprint for all private routes in the application. If the user is logged in, this route will take the user where he want's to go. Or if the user not logged in, then this route will take the user to the log in or signup page.

                        Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to serving requests. In other words, Node.js wastes no time or resources on waiting for I/O requests to return. It is a used as backend service where javascript works on the server-side of the application. This way javascript is used on both frontend and backend. Node.js runs on chrome v8 engine which converts javascript code into machine code, it is highly scalable, lightweight, fast, and data-intensive.
